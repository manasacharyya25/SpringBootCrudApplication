## Assignment
  Design and implement a SpringBoot Java API that manages users and persists them in a PostgresDB.

## User:
* Name
* Email
* BirthDate

## Business Rules:
* Email must be unique

The API should implement Create, Read, Update and Delete endpoints.

## Deliverables:
* A solution that implements Create, Read, Update and Delete endpoints
* A solution that is 100% tested via automation
* A solution that follows the SOLID principles and other best practices
* A solution that does not require any manual setup, besides setting up environment variables.
  * Deploying Postgres is outside of the scope
* A read me that explains how to run the solution
